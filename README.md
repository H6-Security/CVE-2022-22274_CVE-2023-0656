# SonicWall NGFW CVE-2022-22274 & CVE-2023-0656

![example gif](example.gif)

On March 24, 2022, SonicWall released an [advisory](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0003) with the following details:

> A Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SonicOS via HTTP request allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially results in code execution in the firewall.

> NOTE: This vulnerability ONLY impacts the "web management" interface, the SonicOS SSLVPN interface is not impacted.

On March 2, 2023, SonicWall released another, similar, [advisory](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0004):

> A Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SonicOS allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS), which could cause an impacted firewall to crash.

> NOTE: This vulnerability ONLY impacts the "web management" interface, the SonicOS SSLVPN interface is not impacted.

Both issues are related to the same vulnerable code pattern and use the same exploit payload, but are triggered at different URI paths.

## Description

The buffer overflow is triggered via an HTTP request with a URI path longer than 1024 characters. CVE-2022-22274 can be exploited at `/resources/` or at the Advanced Threat Protection URI path (`/atp/` if enabled or `//` if disabled). CVE-2023-0656 can be exploited at `/stats/` or `/Security_Services`.

This repository contains a proof-of-concept script to test a target for exploitability at all four URI paths. It performs a safe test by default, but has the ability to exploit the bugs and crash the target as well.



## Usage

Install Python 3 and run `python -m pip install -y argparse`.

```
usage: poc.py [-i ips.csv]

options:
  -i		           import a csv file. CSV needs to be in the same directory. 

```

## Examples

Test a vulnerable target:

```
$ ./poc_db.py -i ips.csv
